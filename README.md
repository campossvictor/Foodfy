# Foodfy

The website Foodfy was created during the "Front-End" module of LauchBase course give by RocketSeat.
While I made the module, I learned about HTML structure, CSS styling and Javascript. The codes it's not perfect and it isn't the cleaner code of the world,
but I was able to apply these knowledges in my page.



## Development

### First Step

Firstly, I separeted the HTML, CSS and Javascript files in diferent folders like:

- Views (for .html files)
- Public
  - styles (for .css files)
  - scripts (for .js files)
  - assets (for images.png, etc.. )
 
 Secondly, I created HTML structure imagining the page semantics, thinking how I could bring more acessibility
 and how I would manipulate that structure on CSS.
 
 OBS: I told you again: the structure is not perfect, but I'm studing for make it better.
 
 ### Styling Page
 
 Thirdly, I styled the pages based on files made avaialble by the course. This course files showed me the webpage design like: 
 the margins, borders, paddings, sizes, etc..of images and text content
 
  ### Dinamic Page
  
 And finally, I created an dinamic page with Javascript. The dynamism was based on "EventListener", "querySelector" and "getAtributte".
 
 Well, its simples but its just the begin!
 
 So, below you can view my page and you can verify the codes in my repository.
